## DOM manipulation

Document object model - "It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content."(from MDN)

I learned how to use javascript to manipulate the way a web page appears.
``` const h1 = document.querySelector('h1')
    h1.style.color = 'red'
```
### Tools

* `querySelector`
* `querySelectorAll`
* `getAttribute`
* `setAttribute`
* `appendChild`
